BiYooc a Practical Bidiriectional Object Oriented Compiler.
===============================================================================

BiYoocc (built on top of Eiffel and Yocc) is a great tool to develop bidirectional compilers.

A bidirectinnal compiler is one in which the pretty printing of the parsed tree (AST) is also valid code.
One would expect this to be the default rather than the exception.
But most pretty printers evolve independently from the compiler, which leads to incompatibilites between them.

This has lead to the development of parser generators (BiYacc) with the express purpose of having bidirectionallity by default.

On this paper we intend to show that developing bidirectional parsers is not something extraourdinary.
But a naturally expressed as part of Eiffel's design-by-contract and it's invariant mechanism.

The invariant that defines a bidirectional parser is:

    parse(pretty_print(parse(source))) = parse (source)

Which basically means, parsing the pretty_printed version of a source code is equivalent to parsing the source code.

This invariant is naturally expressed in eiffel.

In order to demonstrate our claim that Eiffel and Yoocc make it easy to evolve a pragramming language grammar into bidirectionality.
We will follow the following stages.

Stage 0: Update Yoocc to modern eiffel.
    On this stage the goal is to get the demo languages developed with Yoocc to compile again.
    1. We take the Yoocc compiler developed by Monash University.
    2. Take the example languages as part of the Yoocc distribution and
   shhow that the pretty printed code generated with it is not, bidirectional.

Stage 1: Evolve demo languages to be bidirectional

    1.1 Add the invariant of Listing 1 to the Yoocc compiler.
    1.2 Try to compile the generated languages and follow the errors generated, until there is none.
    1.3 Show that the pretty_printed version of the example languages are bidirectional.
    1.4 With this we would have demostrated that is possible to evolve a language to be bidirectional without changing it's grammar.

Stage 2: Develop a document syncronizer (Java and HTML)
    in BiOOP Zheng takes a light version of Java and Spring and creates an html version of the interface created with it.
    Then changes made to the HTML are automatically sinchronized to the Java Source code.

    So the idea would be to reproduce the same functionallity.

Stage 3: Develop BiPandoc

    Pandoc is a document translator, it take documents written in let's say markdown and translate to multiple formats.
    And yet in such a tool, the transformations aren't bidirectional. For example it is possible to translate from a source format to another but not the other way around.
    However if each pandoc language used was made with BiYoocc the translation would be bidirectional by default.

    Here obivously the complexity is in developing the translators for several languages.

Stage 4: Muliti-langugae programming.
    If every langugae is equivalent to each other (turing complete).
    How far could we take the idea of programming in one language and another using the same.
