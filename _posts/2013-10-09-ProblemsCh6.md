Excercise 2
============================================================
Check your understanding of or, and, and not by deciding what
value each of these expressions has and then evaluating it with the com-
puter (you will need to import the Stdm module provided on the web
page for this book):


{% highlight haskell %}

 False /\ True
 True \/ (not True)
 not (False \/ True)
 (not (False /\ True)) \/ False
 (not True) ==> True
 True \/ False ==> True
 True ==> (True /\ False)
