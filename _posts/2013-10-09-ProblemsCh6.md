  This are the solutions to chapter 6 of [Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jtod/discrete-mathematics/). You will also need the code at:

Excercise 2
============================================================
Check your understanding of or, and, and not by deciding what
value each of these expressions has and then evaluating it with the com-
puter (you will need to import the Stdm module provided on the web
page for this book):


{% highlight haskell %}

 False /\ True
 True \/ (not True)
 not (False \/ True)
 (not (False /\ True)) \/ False
 (not True) ==> True
 True \/ False ==> True

Excercise 22
============================================================
Suppose we simply replace R ∧ Q below the {∧I} line with
Q∧R. This fixes the Invalid And-Introduction error, but it introduces
another error into the proof.
