2023-Oct-30: Data oriented programming
=========================================================

This is a practical book on how to develop according to a paradigm that he calls Data oriented programming.
It sits between a business novel like the goald and a to-do book.

The major parts I can find are:

- The problems with OOP, as representative of mutable state
- Separating data and functions
- Usind mutable data structures | the first apprach
  - How to add new functions with only the transformation of the original JSON structures
- Using inmutable data structures to do the same. here with the lodash library
- Using persitent data structures to try to get performance.. through concurrency.
  - this datastructures use smart algorithms to be extremely efficient when reading and writing.

The author tries to show that his method makes software that is easier to develop and easier to extend.

Positive things

- I thing this could be a way to implement Concept Oriented design
- I like that I think it can receive a complex tree but you are only interested in a part that you can use...
  So if you asy you are expecting an objject with name and last name.
  and you receive an object that als containts date of birth, age, etc.
  that doen't throw an exeception the method just returns a new object with only the parts modified.

Question that I have
- How to work with relational data, not only hierrachical (json) data.
- How doe it differ from dataflow oriented programming.
