                            **A personal knoledge filesystem**

2023-Nov-22: Knowledge Filesystem
===========================================================
There is an explosion on what are called thiniking tools (Roam, Obsidian, etc.) evidence ____
However most of this tools store their knowledge base as markdown notes.
But our the nodes oun our  knowledge come in many forms:
- Images, Videos, Bookmarks, PDFs, etc.
So we need to create system that allows for the storage and liking of all the information we already posses.
In order to gain the benefits of a truly personal knowledge graph.

There have been attempts in the past to create a Filesystem that works more like a databes of Atributes than as a tree of files and directories.
starting with BeOS, and also DeepFS and even Windows 7 had an attempt to provide that.
And we al so have the NHFS to tag files using different attributes as folders.

However, those approaches are not popular.
So there is a need for a graph filesystem that can represent a knowledge graph
but we think those approaches were not successful for the following reasons:

1. They have usabulity problems (as is theorized on the thesis....)
2. They have reliability problems (i.e. they might loose files)
3. They have bad integration with common unix tools such as cp, mv, etc.
4. There is not a protection warranty about the storage of the files.

However several improvements in the past years make this goal worth revisiting.

1. The Eiffel programming language and Invariants in Design By Contract,
   make developing a realiable filesystem a lot easier than the current state of the practice which is Python and C++

2. The developmente of test suite with 100,000 of tests that we can use as an oracle to validate our implementation
3. The deveolpment of a verified filesystem.
4. The content indexing of files using Inter Planetary FileSystem (IPFS).
5. The explosion in the use of the Zettelkasten method and the so called thinking tools.

So maybe Personal Knowledge Graph Filesystem is an idea whose time has come.
And we intend to find out, by building a truly reliable system.
That can last for generations.
