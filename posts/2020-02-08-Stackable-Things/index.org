My favorite things are stackable things. They fulfill  their function when you need them, and store nicely when you don't. Achieving the separation in time principle.
Here are my favorite examples of this in action:

** Coffe cups
My friend Carlos López de Lara owns "[[https://www.facebook.com/vendimiapizza/][La Vendimia]]", a super nice coffee shop. There they have many types of coffee cups my favorite by far is this:

Because it has the magic of stackable:

Let's compare this with the alternative, unstackable coffe mugs:

** Chairs
   Continuing with the coffee shop example there are two kinds of chairs, the practical:

   and the impractical

** Food Containers

   Stacked food containers are good.

   But stacked containers inside each others are better.

** Water thanks

For example in México where I live is common to see in the road trucks fully loaded with water tanks.

But in a trip to Colombia we discovered water tanks, like this one:

On the surface they do the same, however the ones in Colombia are stackable, which makes them much more practical:

** Shipping Containers
   It's hard to remember but there was a time when shipping containers where not the standard and that was a hinderance to global commerce.
   Se we passed of transporting things with different shapes:

   To the much more efficient way to do it now:
