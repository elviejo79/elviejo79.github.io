2023-Oct-28: Mortimer Adler How to Read a Book
======================================================

I read a heading I don't remember where that said:

> It doesn't matter how many books you read, what matters is how many summaries you write.

And I think there is a lot of truth to that sentence.
However even writing a summary is a lot of work,
So I need a way to produce summaries of books in a fast way.

Fortunately there is a book called "How to read a book"
By Mortimer Adler that I think is a master class on how to be an honest intellectual.

What follows is the summary of the How to read a book.
So that I can use it to produce summaries.

This one is taken from:
https://www.scribd.com/document/311241114/Adler-How-to-Read-a-Book

## 0. Systematic skimming or pre-reading

1. Look at the title page and preface, try to pigeonhole type of book.
1. Study the table of contents look for structure / roadmap for the trip.
1. Check the index try to estiate range of terms and topics; look up some passages that seem crucial.
1. Check the publishers blurb / summary of the book. Also the preface
1. Look for chapters whic seem most pivotal: read opening or closing pages carefully.
1. Thumb throught he entire book, reading a few paragraphs here and there, esp. at the en looking for the main arguments.

## 1. Superficial reading

1. Read thourugh "without ever stoppyng to lookup or ponder the things you do not understand right away"
1. "Go right on [until] you come to things you do understand. Concentrate on these. keep on this way." (e.g. reading Shakespeare!)

a. "Many book are hardly worth even skimming"
a. "some should be read quickly"
a. "a few should be read, quite slow... allowing for complete comprehension".. Like little sips.

Even difficult books have some material which can be read quickly.

a. "Race through even the hardest book". the first through.
a. "You will then be prepared to read it well the second time."

## 2. Inspectional reading

1. What is the book about as whole? Subject / classification
1. "What is being said in detail, and how?" Terms / interpretation
1. "Is the book true, in whole or part?" Truth / evaluation
1. "What of it?" Significance / Response

### Three kinds of note taking

a. Structural about the content of the subject
a. Conceptual about the truth and significance
a. Dilectical about the shape of the argument in the larger discussion of other peoples ideas.

## 3. Analytical Reading




2023-Oct-26: Algorithms at the Movies
======================================================

![Angels and Demons Movie Poster](./images/Angels_and_demons.jpg)

In the movie "Angels & Demons," there's a scene where an "antimatter bomb" is introduced. The prevailing idea is that once the antimatter comes into contact with matter, both the Vatican and Rome would vanish.

The Illuminati (the antagonists) send the police a live feed of the ticking bomb.

Camerlengo, the priestly manager of the Vatican (played by Ewan McGregor), suggests to the police that they should turn off the city's electricity, block by block, to identify the source of the live feed.

These constant shutdowns create challenges for Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the scientist assisting him.

Upon watching the movie, I pondered: Why turn off the city lights block by block? That's a sequential algorithm! A Binary Search would be much more efficient.

Let's assume, for instance, that Rome has 64 blocks. Following the movie's sequential approach, there would be 64 blackouts. If each blackout lasts 1 minute, it would take more than one hour to find the bomb.

With Binary Search:

*    * * * * * * * *     *
*                        *
**************************


Turn off the electricity for the entire city (64 blocks) to ensure the bomb's lights are grid-connected. If they aren't, the blackout strategy is moot.

*                        *
**************************


Assuming the chamber's lights go off, they would next shut down half the city's electricity (32 blocks). If the bomb's lights go off, then the correct half was chosen. If not, the bomb is in the other half.

*    o o o o o o o o     *
*                        *
**************************


Repeat the process with the selected half, then continue halving 5 more times (16, 8, 4, 2, 1) until the bomb's location is determined.

**************************


With this approach, the bomb can be located with just 7 blackouts (1 complete + 6 halves).
Crisis averted!

In this movie, the expert  symbologist Langdon wasn't necessary to save the city.
What they truly needed was a computer science...
