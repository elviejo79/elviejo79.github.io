? Why is there no silver bullet in software engineering?
 . Silver Bullet: any software engineering development that can produce a tenfold or better improvement in programming productivity.
 * Essential difficulties : Those related to conceptualization design
    What are the essential difficultios of designing software?
        * Complexity: no two parts alike; many states; nonlinear interactions between modules.
        * Comformity: must conform to arbritray conditions (business rules, existin systems)
        * Changeability: often required to change difficulty of change understimated.
        * Invisibility: structure cannot be vsualized (flowcharts and visual modelling languages are very limited)
 ? What silver bullets have been proposed to date?
