? Why is there no silver bullet in software engineering?
 . Silver Bullet: any software engineering development that can produce a tenfold or better improvement in programming productivity.
 * Essential difficulties : Those related to conceptualization design
    ? What are the essential difficultios of designing software?
        * Complexity: no two parts alike; many states; nonlinear interactions between modules.
        * Comformity: must conform to arbritray conditions (business rules, existin systems)
        * Changeability: often required to change difficulty of change understimated.
        * Invisibility: structure cannot be vsualized (flowcharts and visual modelling languages are very limited)
 ? What silver bullets have been proposed to date?
    * These address indcidental difficulties (those related to implementation).
         for example?
            * OOP
                + Improved programmer productivity (ipp)
                - Do not help in software design (nodesing)
            * Better Hardware
                # ipp ---- notice that I mean a reference to the same above
                # nodesign ----notice that I mean a reference to the one above (so a pro and a con the same way)
            * High level languages
                # ipp
                # nodesign
            * Better tools - IDEs, etc.
                # ipp
                # no design
            * AI / Expert systems
                - limited applicability (la)
                # no design
            * Program Verification
