# Hello World from Bash

On this tutorial we are going to learn about the `echo` command in Bash
This command prints to the screen whatever you send it.

It's as easy as:

```{.bash .cb_test}
@learner $ echo "hello world"
@learner hello world
```

The great power of Unix is the pipe "|" the idea to connect programs that weren't made to be connected.
so if we connect 'str_to_upper' to our previous command we will get:


```{.prysk .cb_test}
@learner $ echo "hello world" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
@learner HELLO WORLD
```
