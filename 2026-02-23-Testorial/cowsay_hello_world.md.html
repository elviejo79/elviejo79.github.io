# Creating a Bash Script

In our previous tutorial we executed commands in command line to say "hello world"

But that is kind of boring.
So now we will have a cow say it!

First, let's check if we have the `cowsay` program installed:

~~~bash
@learner $ dpkg --status cowsay
@learner dpkg-query: package 'cowsay' is not installed and no information is available
@learner Use dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files.
@learner $
~~~

Since it is not in our system, we need to install it.
~~~bash
@learner $ sudo apt install cowsay #=> --exit 0
~~~

Once the installation ends successfully you can verify,
you have `cowsay` installed

~~~bash
@learner $ cowsay -h
@learner cow{say,think} version 3.03, (c) 1999 Tony Monroe
@learner Usage: cowsay [-bdgpstwy] [-h] [-e eyes] [-f cowfile]
@learner           [-l] [-n] [-T tongue] [-W wrapcolumn] [message]
@learner $
~~~

now we can tell a cow to tell 'hello'

~~~ bash
@learner $ cowsay Hello World
@learner  _____________
@learner < Hello World >
@learner  -------------
@learner         \   ^__^
@learner          \  (oo)\_______
@learner             (__)\       )\/\
@learner                 ||----w |
@learner                 ||     ||
@learner $
~~~

Isn't a `cowsay`ing so much cooler?
