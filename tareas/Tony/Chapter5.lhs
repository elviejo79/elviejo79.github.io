Excercise 1
===========
Define a Haskell datatype Tree1 for a tree that contains a character and an integer in each node, along with exactly three subtrees.

{% highlight haskell %}

> import Test.HUnit
> data Tree1 = Tree1Leaf
>            |Tree1Node Char Integer Tree1 Tree1 Tree1


{% endhighlight %}


Exercise 2.
===========
Define a Haskell datatype Tree2 for a tree that contains an integer in each node, and that allows each node to have any number of subtrees.

{% highlight haskell %}

> data Tree2 = Tree2Leaf
>            |Tree2Node Integer [Tree2]

{% endhighlight %}

Exercise 3.
==========
Calculate the inorder traversal of tree3.

{% highlight haskell %}

> data BinTreeInt = Leaf
>                | Node Integer BinTreeInt BinTreeInt
>
> tree3 :: BinTreeInt
> tree3 =
>  Node 4
>    (Node 2
>      (Node 1 Leaf Leaf)
>      (Node 3 Leaf Leaf))
>    (Node 7
>       (Node 5
>       Leaf
>       (Node 6 Leaf Leaf))
>    (Node 8 Leaf Leaf))

-- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

{% endhighlight %}


Exercise 4.
===========
Suppose that a tree has type BinTree a, and we have a function
f :: a -> b. Write a new traversal function
inorderf :: (a->b) -> BinTree a -> [b] that traverses the tree using inorder,
but it applies f to the data value in each node before placing the result in the list.
For example, inorder tree6 produces [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
but inorderf (2*) tree6 produces [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14].

{% highlight haskell %}


> data BinTree a
>     = BinLeaf
>     | BinNode a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)
>     deriving Show
>
> tree6 :: BinTree Int
> tree6 = BinNode 4
>             (BinNode 2
>                 (BinNode 1 BinLeaf BinLeaf)
>                 (BinNode 3 BinLeaf BinLeaf))
>             (BinNode 6
>                 (BinNode 5 BinLeaf BinLeaf)
>                 (BinNode 7 BinLeaf BinLeaf))
>
> inorder :: BinTree a -> [a]
> inorder BinLeaf = []
> inorder (BinNode x t1 t2) = inorder t1 ++ [x] ++ inorder t2
>
> -- tests
> t4 = ["For example, inorder tree6 produces [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]," ~: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] ~=? (inorder tree6)
>      ,"but inorderf (2*) tree6 produces [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]." ~: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14] ~=? (inorderf (2*) tree6 )]
>
>inorderf::(a->b)->BinTree a->[b]
>inorderf f BinLeaf = []
>inorderf f (BinNode x t1 t2) = inorderf f t1 ++ [f x] ++ inorderf f t2

Exercise 5.
===========
Define two trees of size seven, one with the largest possible height and the other with the smallest possible height.

{% highlight haskell %}

> height :: BinTree a -> Integer
> height BinLeaf = 0
> height (BinNode x t1 t2) = 1 + max (height t1) (height t2)
>
> size :: BinTreeInt -> Int
> size Leaf = 0
> size (Node x t1 t2) = 1 + size t1 + size t2
>
> balanced :: BinTree a -> Bool
> balanced BinLeaf = True
> balanced (BinNode x t1 t2) =
>   balanced t1 && balanced t2 && (height t1 == height t2)

{% endhighlight %}

Exercise 6.
===========
Suppose that the last equation of the function balanced were
changed to the following:

  balanced (BinNode x t1 t2) = balanced t1 && balanced t2

Give an example showing that the modified function returns True for an unbalanced tree.

{% highlight haskell %}

>--balanced :: BinTree a -> Bool
>--balanced BinLeaf = True
>--balanced (BinNode x t1 t2) = balanced t1 && balanced t2

>exercise6::BinTree Int
>exercise6 = BinNode 1
>				BinLeaf
>				(BinNode 2
>					BinLeaf
>					BinLeaf)

{% endhighlight %}



Exercise 7.
===========
Suppose that the last equation of the function balanced were
changed to the following:

  balanced (BinNode x t1 t2) = height t1 == height t2.

Give an example showing that the modified function returns True for an unbalanced tree.

{% highlight haskell %}

>balanced :: BinTree a -> Bool
>balanced BinLeaf = True
>balanced (BinNode x t1 t2) = height t1 == height t2

>height :: BinTree a -> Integer
>height BinLeaf = 0
>height (BinNode x t1 t2) = 1 + max (height t1) (height t2)

>exercise7::BinTree Int
>exercise7 = BinNode 1
>				(BinNode 2
>					(BinNode 3
>						(BinNode 4
>							BinLeaf
>							BinLeaf)
>						BinLeaf)
>					BinLeaf)
>				(BinNode 5
>					(BinNode 6
>						BinLeaf
>						BinLeaf)
>					(BinNode 7
>						(BinNode 8
>							BinLeaf
>							BinLeaf)
>						BinLeaf))


{% endhighlight %}


Exercise 8.
==========
Define a function mapTree that takes a function and applies it to
every node in the tree, returning a new tree of results. The type should
be

  mapTree :: (a->b) -> BinTree a -> BinTree b

This function is analogous to map, which operates over lists.

{% highlight haskell %}

>mapTree :: (a->b) -> BinTree a -> BinTree b
>mapTree f BinLeaf = BinLeaf
>mapTree f (BinNode a t1 t2) = BinNode (f a) (mapTree f t1) (mapTree f t2)


{% endhighlight %}

Exercise 9.
===========
Write concatTree, a function that takes a tree of lists and concatenates
the lists in order from left to right. For example,

  concatTree (Node [2] (Node [3,4] Tip Tip) (Node [5] Tip Tip)) ==> [3,4,2,5]

{% highlight haskell %}

>concatTree::BinTree [a]->[a]
>concatTree BinLeaf = []
>concatTree (BinNode x t1 t2) = concatTree t1 ++ x ++concatTree t2


{% endhighlight %}



Exercise 10.
============
Write zipTree, a function that takes two trees and pairs each
the corresponding elements in a list. Your function should return Nothing
if the two trees do not have the same shape. For example,

  zipTree (Node 2 (Node 1 Tip Tip) (Node 3 Tip Tip)) (Node 5 (Node 4 Tip Tip) (Node 6 Tip Tip))
  ==> Just [(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)]

{% highlight haskell %}

>zipTree::BinTree a->BinTree b->Maybe [(a,b)]
>zipTree BinLeaf t2 = Nothing
>zipTree t1 BinLeaf = Nothing 
>zipTree (BinNode a t1 t2) (BinNode b t3 t4) = case (zipTree t1 t3) of
>												Nothing -> Nothing
>												Just lst1 ->
>													case (zipTree t2 t4)> of
>														Nothing -> Nothing
>														Just lst2 -> Just (lst1 ++ [(a,b)] ++ lst2)


{% endhighlight %}


Exercise 11.
============
Write zipWithTree, a function that is like zipWith except that
it takes trees instead of lists. The first argument is a function of type
a->b->c, the second argument is a tree with elements of type a,and the
third argument is a tree with elements of type b. The function returns a
list with type [c]

{% highlight haskell %}

>zipWithThree::(a->b->c)->BinTree a->BinTree b->[c]
>zipWithThree f t1 BinLeaf = []
>zipWithThree f BinLeaf t2 = []
>zipWithThree f (BinNode a t1 t2) (BinNode b t3 t4) = zipWithThree f t1 t3 ++ [f a b] ++ zipWithThree f t2 t4


{% endhighlight %}


Exercise 12.
============
Write appendTree, a function that takes a binary tree and a
list, and appends the contents of the tree (traversed from left to right) to
the front of the list. For example,

  appendTree (BinNode 2 (BinNode 1 BinLeaf BinLeaf)
                (BinNode 3 BinLeaf BinLeaf))
               [4,5]

evaluates to [1,2,3,4,5]. Try to find an efficient solution that minimises recopying.

{% highlight haskell %}
>appendTree::BinTree a -> [a]
>appendTree BinLeaf = []
>appendTree (BinNode x t1 t2) = appendTree' (BinNode x t1 t2) []

>appendTree'::BinTree a->[a]->[a]
>appendTree' BinLeaf xs = xs
>appendTree' (BinNode x t1 t2) xs = appendTree' t1 (x : appendTree' t2 xs)
