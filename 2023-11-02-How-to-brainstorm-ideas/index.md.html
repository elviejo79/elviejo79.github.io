2023-Nov-2: How to brainstorm ideas.
==========================================================
This is my response to an stack exchange question:

https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/69785/a-graph-system-for-drawing-conclusions/149126#149126


```
? How can a community of users draw conclusions together?
 ! They could use IBIS / Issue mapping
   ? What is IBIS
    ! Ibis is a syntax that was used in the 70s to help groups collaborate on wicked problems.
     - But I don't want to use something from the 70s
     + In the 90s they created an updated version of it based on computer interaction.
     ? Where can I learn more about IBIS?
       ! IBIS videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1IrP_dkJL9rQMtPN3ExxG5uVEHmvLFw4
       ! IBIS books: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/82326491-alejandro-garcia?shelf=ibis-dialogue-mapping
       ! This blog: https://www.cleverworkarounds.com/2009/09/10/the-practice-of-dialogue-mapping-part-1/
     ? Do you have an example of an IBIS map?
