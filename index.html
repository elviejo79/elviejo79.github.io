I started this adventure with the only software thath I love&#x2026; emacs with org-mode.

tangle of files allows one to write a program step by step. Just what you want in a tutorial.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

you cannot modify a line of a tangled file. so the code that you write should be in it's final version.
probably there is a way to go over this problem but I couldn't find it.

then I went down the rabbit hole of tutorials based on git commits. where each commit has a litle bit of the evolution of the code and then you export that change history as the tutorial itself.
the key with this kind of tutorials are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the commit history must be in a logical format. which normally includes using <code>rebase</code> a lot. which isn't fun and</li>
<li>each commit message should be formated as markdown so that when you export the tutorial it can be read in order.</li>

this tool helps with writing it acnowledges that writin the tutorial and the commits to get there are different things. also one chapter can reference multiple commits.

git tutor takes the diff history of the commit hooks. It displays each commit code with the deleted lines and the added lines per commit.
this is important to the evolution of code.

This is allows separation of writing and commits. generates a markdown of all the history and then you can modify the article generated.
it's the idea that got me in this road.

has the nicest output of all, the tuorial is html5 and the default CSS looks a little bit like read the docs.
It uses the proper idea where the title of the commit is the heading of the step.
the problem is that there is no separation between writing the text of the tutorial and the commit steps.
and this problem is bigger with Kondiment because the ouput is already html5&#x2026; not markdown so althought the output is pretty is not easily editable.

now it seems there is a <code>begig_src diff</code> block that can present diff in a nice way.
so I could.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>write the tutorial as a series of git commits.</li>
<li>order and edit the history, using stgit</li>
<li>generate a diff patch file that could be used as the beginnig of an org-mode file.</li>
<li>on each section of the diff insert links to the revision, and the repository with orgit</li>
<li>add more instructions and text to the tutorial&#x2026;</li>
<li>export it to markdown and from there to a website.</li>

<p>
On my previous post I was trying to decide how to write a tutorial, that showed the evolution of the code.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to be:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>as close as possible to literate programming</li>
<li>to be abele to show changes in the code, the lines that I deletede and added</li>
<li>and to be able to change it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the end the workflow that I setteld on was:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use stg init (to use git commits a stack)</li>
<li>Do</li>
</ol>
<p>
1.1 Write a couple of lines in a file
1.2 Commit with a heading written in Markdown
1.3 stg refresh
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>while still have something to say</li>
<li>Reorder commits (or patches as they are called in stgit) until you have a logical order</li>
<li>Export the series of commits to markdown tutotiarl with git-tutorial.</li>
<li>Edit the exported markdown tutorial.</li>
<li>convert to html</li>
</ol>

<p>
The process was very slow, because of lack of familiarity wit the tools.
But I did finish a pretty simple tutorial.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure that the benefits outweight the costs.
</p>

<p>
but definitively, where not yet there.
</p>

<p>
I would want somethnig that generates a literate program, like org-mode tangle.
BUT that is aware of changes in the code repository.
</p>

<p>
Because that gives times.
